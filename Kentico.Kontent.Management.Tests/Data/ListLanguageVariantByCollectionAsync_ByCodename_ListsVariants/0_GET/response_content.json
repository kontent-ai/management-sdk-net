A journey full of possible pitfalls, which can, usually negatively, influence the coffee’s final taste. What goes wrong at the very beginning cannot be made up for at the very end.</p><p>The character and taste of a coffee are largely influenced by its origin, climate, the quality and type of soil and the botanical varieties of the coffee plant.</p><p>The last two links of the chain—the roastery and the barista—cannot, in any way, improve the taste of the coffee. They are left with the difficult task of making the most its potential.</p><p>The farmers themselves, however, have at their disposal tools for enhancing the ‘ingrown’ taste of the coffee. These are mainly the methods of removing the multilayered skin of the coffee beans.</p><p>Two, sometimes three basic methods are usually referred to. Wet-Processed (Fully-Washed), Dry-Processed (Natural) and Pulped-Natural (Semi-Washed).</p><p>Dry processing, being the least economically demanding, used to be the most widely used of the methods. More exclusive beans are now usually processed using the wet and pulped-natural processing. This is due to the quality and cleanliness of the beans, as well as the speed of the whole process. If you are curious about the taste, go ahead and try the <a data-item-id=\"f26b3b85-9cbf-4ae8-8d04-ac084487cb7c\">Kenya Gakuyuni AA</a>.</p><p>Wet processing rids the cherry of its layers and pulp by water fermentation. The exocarp is removed from the cherries directly after the harvest using circular and drum mechanical peelers. Afterwards, they spend 6-72 hours in water-filled fermentation tanks.</p><p>In the tank, microorganisms take care of the pulp (mesocarp). The length of the process is determined by the stickiness of the beans. Leaving beans in the fermentation tank for too long produces the so-called ‘naughty’ beans. These are often beans that have stuck in the tank and their rancid and putrid state endangers the whole batch.</p><p>The constantly rising levels of acetic acid are also able to impact the taste of the coffee with fermented and even vinegarish tones once it’s been roasted. The main negative aspect of wet processing is the amount of water that has to be used. This is up to 40m3 (40000 liters) of water, that have to be continuously dumped and new, clean water has to be put pumped into the tank. The dumping of contaminated water often depreciates the water supplies laying underneath the coffee farm.</p><p>The dry method, considered the most traditional and the least costly, makes use of sun-drying. Cherries are often sundried on concrete courtyards, Ethiopian hilltops, and sometimes even on the very shrubs.</p><p>Cherries need to be sundried directly after the harvest to avoid unwanted fermentation. The laid out beans need to be layered evenly and not more than 6 inches (15cm) in height. Farmers turn the seeds over both manually or with the use of tractors.</p><p>During the dry fermentation, the sugars travel, via osmosis, from the pulp into the beans. This makes for more full-bodied coffee and adds sweeter tones to the taste, as compared to wet processed coffee. This often comes at the cost of a more polluted cup.</p><p>Once the coffee beans reach some 11 % humidity, the peel layers and pulp can be removed using mechanical peelers. Reaching the desired humidity takes anywhere between 10 and 30 days. This is an important factor, especially in unstable climates, where automatic driers often replace the traditional sun drying process.</p><p>Now’s the time for ‘reposo’, a resting time, in which the beans lay in a parchment for 30-60 days.</p><p>The third method, popular primarily in Brazil, is the so-called Pulped-Natural or Semi-Washed way of processing beans. Check out our <a data-item-id=\"60214236-d2b8-40dd-a050-b59c1c7a52ef\">Brazil Natural Barra Grande</a> coffee for a tasty example. Only the top layer of the cherry peel is removed in a water bath. The rest of the process, including the sugar fermentation and the separation of the pulp from the bean, are taken care of by sun drying. This method, just like the dry method, is highly dependent on the weather, which has to be consistent for the farmers to be able to dry the beans thoroughly.</p><p>This process yields full-bodied beans with low-acidity. Less aliphatic acids are produced, which has a negative impact on the aroma of the coffee.</p>"

          "value": "<p>Not that long ago, actually back in the early 2000s, coffee making industry had a single aim: convenience. It may have been hand in hand with the rising economic growth. Everyone felt they had to stay busy and get as much done as possible in order to succeed at their lives. Making coffee was usually the matter of pressing a single button. Convenience brought us the likes of Tassimo, Nespresso and other many similar amenities.</p><p>Nowadays, though, everything seems to be slowing down. People take time. Or maybe, they just gave up and they don't bother being in a rush any more. This brought a renaissance of rediscovering the forgotten. Decades old brewing techniques, otherwise performed only by baristas and the geekiest of coffee enthusiasts, are finding their way into everyone’s homes.</p><p>The variety of devices can easily scare the uninitiated off, though. Looking at some of the more complicated brewers especially so. Take vacuum coffee makers, for example. They look like they’ve been taken straight from a chemist lab and that handling them incorrectly could make the whole block go off. Not surprisingly, then, many of us give up and opt for the ‘convenient’ way.</p><p>In this article, we’ll go through some of the simple of these brewing methods. Just to show you that they’re nothing to be afraid off. Making a proper cup of coffee can be super simple. Let’s get to it.</p><h3>Chemex</h3><p>We won’t lie. This one’s our favorite. It’s super easy to use, and it’s got style (go for the wood handle variant)!</p><p>Chemex produces a cup free of any bitterness. We use the 40oz Chemex, which can make 6 to 8 pretty smooth cups at a time.</p><ol>  <li>Grind, or get about 42 grams (5-6 tablespoons) of ground coffee. The coffee shouldn’t be super-smooth, take kosher salt for reference.</li>  <li>Place the Chemex filter inside. Rinse with hot water to seal.</li>  <li>Remove any left-over water.</li>  <li>Add in the ground coffee and stir briefly. This allows for a more even brewing.</li>  <li>Heat water to some 205 degrees F, or let freshly boiled water off the heat for some 30-45 seconds.</li>  <li>Pour just enough water to saturate the grounds. Let it work for 30 seconds.</li>  <li>Now, pour water evenly, spiraling around the inside of the code, until it reaches the top of the brewer.</li>  <li>Keep on adding water periodically, until the brewed coffee reaches the Chemex’s glass button.</li>  <li>Remove the filter and move it to a sink.</li>  <li>Pre-heat your mug with warm water and then pour in the freshly brewed coffee from your Chemex.</li></ol><p>Enjoy! You can easily manipulate the Chemex with the coffee in, as the handle insulates the heat.</p><object type=\"application/kenticocloud\" data-type=\"component\" data-id=\"fc64109e-2317-4e0c-a94c-c5d3bca94ed5\"></object><h3>Clever Dripper</h3><p>This is probably the one that’s easiest to work with. It’s pretty easy to clean up and lets you control the steeping. The brewer is pretty durable and also safe, as it’s 100% BPA free.</p><p>Brews only one cup at a time, but makes a very smooth, almost chocolaty cups.</p><ol>  <li>Grind, or get about 22 grams (3 tablespoons) of ground coffee. Make sure the ground is coarse.</li>  <li>Put the paper filter in and rinse with warm water.</li>  <li>Add the coffee into the dripper.</li>  <li>Pour water and cover with a lid for about 1.5 minutes.</li>  <li>Remove cover, stir and cover again.</li>  <li>After 2 more minutes, stir one last time and place the Clever Dripper on top of a mug.</li>  <li>Start draining until the cup’s full.</li></ol><p>Pretty simple right? The coffee stays in the dripper until you release it yourself, which is pretty convenient. Be careful, though, as leaving the coffee in for too long will make it bitter.</p><h3>Hario V60</h3><p>Similar to the Clever Dripper. Immediately brews into a cup so you don’t have to do the draining yourself.</p><p>Comes made from ceramic, glass or PVC and in tons of colors.</p><p>Produces one cup at a time. The brew has a more ‘roasted’ taste.</p><ol>  <li>Grind, or get about 22 grams (2.5 tablespoons) of ground coffee. Make sure the ground is finer, similar to table salt.</li>  <li>Place a V60 filter into the Hario.</li>  <li>Rinse with hot water and discard. This removes any paper taste.</li>  <li>Add coffee and shake with dripper to level the grounds evenly.</li>  <li>Pour in just enough water to absorb in the coffee. 30ml should do.</li>  <li>Let the water absorb for 45 seconds.</li>  <li>Then, pour hot water steadily over the grounds, topping the Hario. Avoid directly hitting the filter.</li>  <li>Pour the coffee directly into your mug.</li></ol><p>And that’s it. This should be a pretty smooth a cup.</p><p>Don’t forget that you can buy all the three brewers and many others at our store! Let us know if you want to know about other techniques in the comments below.</p>"

So, Kaldi then tried them himself and thus discovered the potential of coffee. And that's where we got our name - Dancing Goat.</p><p>Although it's far more likely that uses for coffee were developed over time and were discovered by people tasting various parts of the cherry, the old fables do add a bit of romance and are very cute.</p><p>Coffee requires a warm climate and lots of moisture, so it is produced within a belt extending around the world between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.</p><p>Coffee grows on trees that flower and produce fleshy red fruit (orange or yellow is also possible) called a drupe though it is popularly referred to as the ‘berry’ or ‘cherry’. What we refer to as coffee beans are actually seeds, which are produced in the centre of the drupe, often in pairs. After harvesting, the flesh of the drupe is washed or dried and the ‘beans’ extracted.</p><p>Coffee beans vary in their shape, size, color as well as flavor depending on the region and conditions in which they were grown. The difference of aromas and flavors between various regional varietals is as vast as the regions they grow in. Just like the teas and wines of the world, and even more so. It is always worth trying new varietals that may stimulate your taste buds in a different way.</p><p>The two major species of coffee are <em>Coffea arabica</em> and <em>Coffea canephora</em> (also called <em>Coffea robusta</em>).</p><p>Arabica is believed to be the first species of coffee to have been cultivated.</p><p>It requires more care during cultivation and is considered to produce better coffee than robusta. Arabica plants grow at high altitudes of around 1,000 to 2,000 meters, approximately 3,200 to 6,500 ft, above sea level in regions across South and Central America as well as Africa. Arabica is costlier to grow as it produces lower yields than Robusta despite requiring more labor. Despite all that, it is considered superior to robusta. The high demand and lower availability drives the price high. Arabica is the species most associated with specialty (sometimes referred to as gourmet) coffees.</p><p>The only place where Arabica coffee grows indigenously is Ethiopia. It is the birthplace of coffee and also the only place in which it truly grows wild. All countries that produce Arabica coffees have transplanted plant stock directly from Ethiopia or from other countries that had already done so.</p>"

This widely known and popular coffee is cultivated in three color varieties, red, orange and yellow bourbon. But what does it have in common with the American whiskey? Nothing at all, fortunately.</p><p>The name comes from the place of origin of this wonderful variety, which is a small island in the Indian Ocean called Réunion, formerly Bourbon. The earliest records mentioning coffee from this lovely volcanic island come from merchants of the East Indian Company and date from the beginning of the 18th century. The first exports started in 1718, and the coffee usually went to Mokka harbor in Yemen and then on to Europe. Exports started off slowly at first. Just less than two tons were shipped in 1724, but this increased rapidly over the next hundred years, peaking at 2,440 tons of coffee per year.</p><p>The coffee, first called Café du Roy, then Café Leroy, was served to kings at the French court and was the brand of choice of the classic author, Honoré de Balzac, who enjoyed forty cups a day. Or so they say…</p><p>The Bourbon variety found its way to Latin America around the middle of the 19th century, where it gradually replaced the older Ethiopian variety, the Arabica Typica, mainly because of its 30% larger yield. While the Arabica Bourbon was doing well in the world, the production on Réunion was slowly, but steadily, decreasing year by year. Farmers opted to grow sugarcane, tea and vanilla beans instead of coffee, and therefore 1942 marked the last export of Arabica Bourbon from the island of Réunion. The last harvest came eight years later and then the variety was forgotten about, even by the locals.</p><p>After almost sixty years, one unrelenting Japanese coffee specialist from Ueshima Coffee Company discovered 27 original plants and restarted production. The resulting coffee is called Bourbon Pointu. It is sold only in Japan and holds the prestigious Premium Product title from the Specialty Coffee Association of Japan. It is also quite pricey, at $35 for 4 ounces.</p><p>The Bourbon Pointu is exceptional for its low volume of caffeine and delicate taste with a slight acidity, low bitterness, full body, and the charming fruit flavor of oranges and tangerines.</p><p>One can only hope that the island of Réunion will eventually return to its former coffee glory and that we will be able to enjoy Bourbon Pointu as well.</p><p>If you are curious about the original taste of Arabica Bourbon, go ahead and try our (Guatemala Finca El Injerto)&nbsp;or newly imported (El Salvador Finca San Jose).</p>"

Este café es myu conocido y se cultiva en tres mutaciones de color, rojo, naranja y amarillo bourbon. Pero ¿qué tiene en común con el whisky americano? Nada de nada, por suerte.</p><p>El nombre proviene del lugar de origen de esta maravillosa variedad, que es una pequeña isla en el Océano Índico llamada Réunion, anteriormente Bourbon. Los registros más antiguos que mencionan café de esta hermosa isla volcánica proceden de comerciantes de la Compañía de la India Oriental y datan de principios del siglo 18. La primera exportación se inició en 1718 y el café por lo general fue vendido en Mokka un puerto en Yemen y luego en Europa. La exportación fue lenta al principio. Sólo menos de dos toneladas fueron enviadas en 1724, pero aumentaron rápidamente en los próximos cien años, alcanzando un máximo de 2 440 toneladas de café al año.</p><p>Primero llamado Café du Roy, entonces Café Leroy se servía a los reyes en la corte francesa y era la marca preferida del autor clásico, Honoré de Balzac, que disfrutaría de cuarenta tazas al día. O eso dicen…</p><p>La variedad Bourbon encontró su camino a América Latina a mediados del siglo 19, en el que sustituyó gradualmente mayor variedad de Etiopía, Arábica Typica, principalmente debido a su 30% mayor rendimiento. Mientras que el Arábica Bourbon estaba haciendo muy bien en el mundo, la producción en la isla de Reunión fue lenta, pero constantemente, diminuindo año tras año. Los agricultores simplemente optaron por cultivar caña de azúcar, té y vainilla en lugar de café, por lo que el año 1942 marca la última exportación de Arábica Bourbon de la isla de Reunión. La última cosecha llegó ocho años más tarde y luego la variedad fue olvidada incluso por los locales.</p><p>Después de casi sesenta años, una especialista en café japonesa de Ueshima Coffee Company descubrió 27 plantas originales y reinicio la producción. El café resultante se llama Burbon Pointu. Se vende sólo en Japón y posee el prestigioso título&nbsp;<em>de primera calidad del producto</em>&nbsp;por Asociación de Cafés Especiales de Japón. También es bastante caro, a $ 35 por cada 100 gramos.</p><p>El Bourbon Pointu es excepcional por su bajo volumen de cafeína y por el sabor delicado con una ligera acidez, amargura, cuerpo entero y encantador sabor de frutas como naranjas y mandarinas.</p><p>Sólo cabe esperar que la isla de Reunión en tiempo vuelva a su antigua gloria y que podamos otra vez disfrutar de Bourbon Pointu también.</p><p>Si tienes curiosidad sobre el sabor original de Arábica Bourbon, tratar con (Guatemala Finca El Injerto)&nbsp;o recién importado (El Salvador Finca San Jose).</p>"

Mr. Imbachi's farm is located in the San Augustin region of Hulia, where he grows this coffee at an altitude of 5,700 feet. &nbsp;</p>"
